# **SSH Log Threat Detection Tool (Python)**

Developed a tool that simulates and analyzes SSH login attempts, flags suspicious IPs based on behavior thresholds, enriches threat intelligence using IPInfo and AbuseIPDB APIs, and visualizes attack patterns through CSV reports and matplotlib charts. Modularized for easy extension and API integration.
